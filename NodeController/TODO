Solve the pedestrain path intersection problem on loading.
twist (minor roads at tilted intersections)
embankment 1:X 2: 
expansion  1:  2: 
slope      1:  2: 


- Esc key.

- allow track middle node modification.

- unfocus text fields when clicking outside the panel.

- lock corners while dragging or using mousewheal
- round values
- hint box
- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- transfer data by patching Split Segment

- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures

- race condition when moving corners on nodes where junction flags has been forced changed.

- lod support (not now)

- Click on a road to insert crossing.

instructions:
o Click on a node to change node type (see screenshots):
o Alt+CLick on a segment end to select it and modify corners ([b]HOT NEW FEATURE!!![/b])
    - Corner smoothness (AKA corner offset): smooth traffic flow, smooth tram tracks, align crossings, resolve road glitches.
    - flat junctions: to give slope to your junctions (more detaisl bellow) 
    - modify corner positions: embnakment,  align highway entry/exit, ...
    - modify corner directions (advanced feature): stretch out end nodes (semi cul-de-sac), customize junction slopes.
o Hold control to hide TMPE markings.

[H1]Give slope to road transitions/intersections[/H1]
uncheck flat junctions of ONLY the two segments that are part of the main road.
segments connected from the side will automatically embank(sideway twist) to match the slope of the intersection.

future work:
change corner offset of left/right segments independantly.

Hello guys, in this video I will show you how to give slope to your intersections.
to do that: uncheck flat junctions ... of ONLY the two segments that are part of the main road.
Notice that the segments on the side are twisted sideways to match the slope of the intersection.
there are a couple of things you can do to fine tune your intersection.
1- the sideway twist on this road continues until the next node. I create a node near the intersection to limit the reach of the twist.
2- now the cars entering this segment are driving UP the intersection. therefore we need to give slope to this segment to avoid suddent changes of slope.
thats it guys. have fun with your intersection slopes.
