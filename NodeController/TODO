- UnitedUI support.
 - bug: its possible for two buttons to be active at the same time.



- assertion fails in hide crossings : Exception: Assertion failed: isJunction | segmentID:27322 nodeID:32742
   - its not a spam. only a few times. its probabely race condition. I also get blue textures for a moment when I am moving corner offset.
   - this happened since when I introduce end node. so maybe I am setting the flags wrong.
- lock corners while dragging or using mousewheal
- big hint box to give instrions and shortcuts.
- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- transfer data by patching Split Segment

- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures

- lod support (not now)


NEW HOT FEATURE! modify corners

instructions:
o Click on a road to insert crossing.
o Click on a node to change node type (see screenshots):
   - middle (no node)
   - crossing
   - u-turn
   - bend/stretch : paint segment texture on node
   - custom.
o Alt+CLick on a segment end to select it (NEW!!!) (does not work with middle node.)
   - hide markings (even if TMPE allows pedestrian crossings)
   - Corner smoothness (AKA corner offset): bigger intersection but better traffic flow. this can also be used to resolve road glitches at sharp angels or super wide roads.
   - flat junctions: to give slope to your junctions (more detaisl bellow) (see screenshots)
   - modify corner positions to align road heights, zebra crossings, highway entry/exit , ... (see screenshots)
   - modify corner directions (advanced feature): you can stretch out end nodes (kind of a cul-de-sac) by increasing horizontal direction. Also to create custom junction slopes change vertical position/direction.
o Hold control to hide TMPE markings.

[H1]Flag junctions[H1]
Vanilla CS automatically flattens out the junctions even if it is unset in asset editor.
with this mod you can give slope to junctions: select the two main roads and uncheck flat junctions. This will automatically embank (twist sideways) minor segments ends.
Advanced tip: don't forget to use move it mod on the other node of embanked segments. you should modify its height (depending on the angle), and bring it closer to junction (to limit the lenght of embankment).
