- fix tool cursor (done not tested)

- fix initial slope: check tan VS atan (partially fixed but still doesn't work)
- release segment ends when segment is released.  (done not tested)
- set segment end to null when new segment is created. (done not tested)
- twist (minor roads at tilted intersections)
- round values
- hint box
- asert dx^2+dz^2 is 1 before slope calculations.. at the very list print warning.
- make slope backward compatible by setting update slope to true when deserializing old version.

- lock corners while dragging or using mousewheal
- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.

- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures

- race condition when moving corners on nodes where junction flags has been forced changed.

- lod support (not now)

- Click on a road to insert crossing.
