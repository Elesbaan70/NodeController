BUG: move middle node/split segment does not work so well

bug: reseting slope alone to default is problematic.

bug: node slider stays transparent even after I move it.

bug: options persistency.


- options for default universal behaviours:
    - auto embankment for curved segments. 

- open and close left and right table.
- new Corner table organisation

- test selecting nodes on top of another road (FRT + anarchy +  moveIT). (can't reproduce)

- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures
- lod support (not now)

- Toggle Crossing tool mod activatble from UUI.
