- UnitedUI support.
 - bug: its possible for two buttons to be active at the same time.


- flat junctions influences minor incomming segments.
- lock corners while dragging or using mousewheal
- big hint box to give instrions and shortcuts.
- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- transfer data by patching Split Segment

- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures

NEW HOT FEATURE! modify corners

instructions:
o Click on a road to insert crossing.
o Click on a node to change node type (see screenshots):
   - middle (no node)
   - crossing
   - u-turn
   - bend/stretch : paint segment texture on node
   - custom.
o Alt+CLick on a segment end to select it (NEW!!!) (does not work with middle node.)
   - hide markings (even if TMPE allows pedestrian crossings)
   - Corner smoothness (AKA corner offset): bigger intersection but better traffic flow. this can also be used to resolve road glitches at sharp angels or super wide roads.
   - flat junctions: to give slope to your junctions (more detaisl bellow) (see screenshots)
   - modify corner positions to align road heights, zebra crossings, highway entry/exit , ... (see screenshots)
   - modify corner directions (advanced feature): you can stretch out end nodes (kind of a cul-de-sac) by increasing horizontal direction. Also to create custom junction slopes change vertical position/direction.
o Hold control to hide TMPE markings.

[H1]Flag junctions[H1]
Vanilla CS automatically flattens out the junctions even if it is unset in asset editor.
with NC you can give slope to junctions: select the two main roads and uncheck flat junctions. This will automatically embank (twist sideways) minor segments ends. 
Advanced tip: use move it mod to move the node at the other end of the embanked segment closer to junction. this will limit the lenght of embankment.
